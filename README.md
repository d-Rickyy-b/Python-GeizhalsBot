# Python-GeizhalsBot
A bot to get notified about changes of the price of a Geizhals.de wishlist.

### Known-Issues
- The bot can currently only fetch prices for wishlists. Later it should be able to track prices of single items.
- The bot is triggered on every change - also if that change is only 0,01â‚¬. Later one should be able to set threshold values.
